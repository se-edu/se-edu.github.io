This GitHub organization is a collection of **FOSS** resources for Software Engineering educators and students. 
In particular, it aims to provide sample code bases that are bigger in size and non-trivial in complexity.

## Sub Projects
These are some of the sub projects (come with code, learning outcomes, exercises, etc.) 

### Project: AddressBook 
A series of Java projects with increasing size and complexity, to be used as examples (or starter projects) in SE courses.

  * [**Level 1**](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level1) [1 KLoC] : Non-OOP, No GUI (Command Line Interface)
  * [**Level 2**](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2) [2 KLoC] : OOP, No GUI (Command Line Interface)
  * [**Level 3**](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) [3 KLoC] : Simple GUI with text input and output<br><br>

  * [**Level 4**](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4) [6 KLoC] : Better GUI and more features<br><br>

  * **Levels 5, 6, ...** (Coming soon)
  
### Project: RCS (Revision Control Software) 
A repo for students to learn the basics of Git and GitHub. {[link to repo](../../../rcs)}

### Project: UML 
{Planned for future} A repo for students to learn various UML diagrams. 

### Project: Collate
A tool for extracting code written by each team member of a team project. {[link to repo](../../../collate)}

## Sister Projects
Here are some other highly-related FOSS projects that are not part of SE-EDU but are run side-by-side by the same folks.

* **TEAMMATES** : [[Product](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com)][[Project](https://github.com/teammates/teammates)] : 
  An online peer feedback management system for education. 
  Used by over 100,000 students and teachers.
* **PowerPointLabs** : 
  [[Product](http://PowerPointLabs.info)][[Project](https://github.com/powerpointlabs/powerpointlabs)] 
  : A productivity tool for Microsoft PowerPoint, especially suitable for students and teachers.
  
* [**OSS-GENERIC/process**](https://github.com/oss-generic/process): A reference process for SE-EDU projects 
  and sister projects. Includes coding standards.
